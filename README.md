##User Questions  
####Goals:

See the results [here](https://camerobarker.typeform.com/report/wZMt9P/SJdO).  

####Findings:  
Find out if people are sharing links with friends and if they are receiving links from friends?
-People are sharing at least weekly and the majority is sharing links and receiving links daily.

Do they share a lot in a day?  
-People find more than 1 link a day to share with their friends but are pretty
split between how many articles their friends share with them.

How do they share?  
-Social media seems to be the main place. I'd hypothesize that this is due to "discovery honor" concept.

Would they like to receive 10 links in realtime, hourly, or at the end of the day?  
-The majority would like to receive one email at the end of the day.
